# Dice-Game
A simple dice game. 
Set a maximum score to reach for a winner to be declared - if not 100 will be the default winning score.
Click 'ROLL DICE" to roll.
Click 'HOLD" to hold current score.
If a player rolls two 6s in one roll, that player loses his entire score and starts from 0.
If a player rolls two 1s in one roll, that player loses his current 'held' score (NOT ENTIRE SCORE).
First player to reach set maximum score is declared winner.

ENJOY!
